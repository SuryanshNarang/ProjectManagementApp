adding Redux Toolkit for global state management:
its usded in sidebar collapsing


we have installed redux-presist just in case we want to store the state in local storage also:
for ex: if the user set the website into dark mode it carries onto the next session if user closes the website then reloads it: then it will be in dark mode only: that's what 
REDUX toolkit allows us to do.
