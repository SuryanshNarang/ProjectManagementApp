import Sidebar from "@app/(components)/Sidebar";
import StoreProvider, { useAppSelector } from "./redux";

  );
  const isDarkMode = useAppSelector((state) => state.global.isDarkMode);
// remember the root of the layout exists in the layout.tsx so there's no way of controlling without using "use Client" component
